# Project Meta

The project is focused around connecting the resource provider to the person in need.
The project will create a platform that will allow the resource provider to broadcast the resources available to them and allow the requirement holder to look for the resources they need.
The project will use dummy data during the development process.

# Project Bullet Points [Decided till this point in time]
### This Section will be updated as time goes on and will contain the points/modules that are finalized to be added to the project.
