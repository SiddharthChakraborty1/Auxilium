This id the Model that I have used to implement the task:

Supplier{
	int id;
	string name;
	enum resource
        {
            Oxygen,
            Masks,
            Food,
            Medications,
            Others
        };
        string state;
        string city;
	int availableQuantity;
	int contactNumber;
}

Availer{
	int id;
	string name;
	enum resource
        {
            Oxygen,
            Masks,
            Food,
            Medications,
            Others
        };
        string state;
        string city;
	int reqAmount;
	int contactNumber;
}

P.S.
These are not at all the final models. These will definately be changed during implementation.
